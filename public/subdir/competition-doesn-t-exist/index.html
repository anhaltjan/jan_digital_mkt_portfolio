### If you don’t know me, you will now. I'm Jan Anhalt a former Japanese denim jeans designer & formalwear fashion consultant currently living in Japan.
<h3>My aim is helping brands targeting males by auditing optimizing their branding and social media strategy, so in the end they can make more money and help more men.. That's all, easy.</h3>
<p>To be straight up with you I just started my career in digital marketing. Currently, I am conducting extensive research about the field and have detected some things that puzzle me. This first blog is to point out one major problem I keep seeing. <strong>There are many digital marketers who cannot even market themselves; which I find sad.</strong></p>
<p>I'm carefully looking at these people and thinking <em>&quot;Do you know what you are even doing?&quot;</em> because to me it seems like you do not, it does not even seem like you are trying. When I see these portfolios, I ask myself <em>&quot;Would I hire them based on what they have provided?&quot;</em> <strong>no I wouldn’t</strong>. Because the initial impression doesn’t inspire confidence that they can perform their job at a high level.</p>
<p><strong>To be honest, right now looking at “lower tier marketers” here is what I see:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People who offer website services with shitty and boring cookie-cutter websites.</li>
<li>Out-of-date blogs, giving the impression they aren't doing their studying.</li>
<li>Social media with 0 to 150 followers, you are in digital marketing?</li>
<li>No valuable content, even worse... no content.</li>
<li>1-5 likes on a post, which is a given</li>
<li>No comments, again no surprised.</li>
<li>No videos posted, which makes sense because they don't even post other forms of content.</li>
<li>No relevant or creative content. I want to see stories about your boring day to day life, not posts.</li>
<li>Private accounts. Which is a big no-no in my no-no book. You know you can make two seperate accounts right? One for family and friends and one for the public. Just saying.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I see all of my &quot;competition&quot; and this what i'm thinking.</p>
<p>How can you sell anyone a service if you can't even sell yourself in the first place?</p>
<p>It doesn't add up.</p>
<p>This is when I realized <strong>I have no competition</strong></p>
<p><strong>From that point on, even with all these people. I realized competition is still exceptionally low because very few of them have the capacity to outperform me.</strong></p>
<p>When I carefully look at Gary Vaynerchuk, Leil/Alex Hormozi, Mr Beast, Casey Neistat, the Kardashian family, The Paul brothers, love him or loathe him and even Donald Trump. I think YEAH! <em>They undoubtedly perform at a high level. They undoubtedly possess a formidable presence. They are never irrelevant; they typically command a substantial following. Furthermore, they constantly provide new and valuable content for people.</em> Therefore, of course I would promptly hire these notable people for my company if they were digital marketers. Why? Because they clearly demonstrate their value furthermore, they express opinion, vision, and creativity.</p>
<h3>What I learned</h3>
<ul>
<li>A person who has social media should be taking advantage of it and post content if not daily, on a weekly basis providing either personal and/or semi-valuable content related to them or their work. (You should be 10X'ing your content)</li>
<li>One person who can do many things can only do them at a mediocre level, one person who focuses on one thing is a master at it. (Stay Niche, and share experience)</li>
<li>A digital marketer who hides her/his face or hides behind a brand seems untrustworthy.</li>
<li>A digital marketer who offers web development services should have a kickass website.</li>
<li>As a human I want to hear the voice of the person, I want to see their personality.</li>
<li>I would hire a new person trying hard to learn over a person who is more senior but less privy to share their knowledge.</li>
<li>Never go out-of-date and always stay relevant</li>
</ul>
