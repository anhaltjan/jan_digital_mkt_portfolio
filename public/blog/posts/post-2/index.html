Title: 		Why my denim brand failed (what would I do now to get filthy rich!)
Post date: 	5/12/2023
If you don’t know me, from now on you will. I'm Jan Anhalt a former Japanese denim jeans designer &amp; formalwear fashion consultant currently living in Japan. My specific focus is working collaboratively with industries intentionally targeting males by optimizing their social media strategy, and content to attain more long-term loyal leads.
To be straight up with you my clothing business failed, it wasn’t due to my product, I made sure it was remarkable. There were three critical problems which inevitably lead me to ultimate failure. The first was unconfidence. The second was perfectionism. These collectively developed my most vital problem; I was petrified of marketing myself and my reputable company.
This is exactly why I naturally started taking on digital marketing. To confront my fears, I need to promptly take my most significant weakness and beef it up into my greatest strength.
Here are a couple of key things I would do differently to save me a lot of time in developing a successful brand.
•	Don’t reinvent the wheel, copy clothing you like and place your brand on it. I would buy a Levi’s or G-Star fit and cut I like in all sizes to produce my base patterns. After that, I would include the specific details I require and WALA! DONE! I have a graded pattern ready in one week.
•	Properly define a target market and inside clearly define 60-100 buyer personas you are targeting. Your specific products need to be worn by the specific people who will spend the money to reach them. For this to happen your marketing must aggressively target them and their lifestyle. For example, a target market could be, self-absorbed males from 25-35. One buyer persona would be: A 30-year-old male, working/living downtown. He makes $50,000/year, he prefers expensive watches (Rolex), Japanese denim (Naked &amp; Famous), and street brands (Supreme). He eats out most nights and goes drinking on the weekend. DONE! 59 – 99 more to go!
•	Don’t fall in love with your brand. If you fall in love with it, you will pursue perfection. This is a trap. If the brand fails, it will kill you. Don’t allow that to happen because you will need to move on.
•	The product will never be perfect. Do not chase perfection. If it rates 65-75/100, it is ready to sell. No customer will see the little mistakes, if they do, they might like it. If they are unhappy about the product give it to them for free, make them another. But get them to give you an awesome review! Now, you have a happy long-term customer with Social Proof behind your brand which could potentially double or triple your sales.
•	Are you a business type or a creative type? Because you can’t be both. Pick one focus, share the wealth find another person to fill the other spot. Alone you will eventually die, together you have a greater chance of success. If it is a family member or friend just make sure you get them to sign a contract so they know you will fire them if they don’t do their job properly.
•	Sell high! Keep expenses low. Do not feel bad for selling high. If people think it is pricey, they are not your buyer persona. For example, I sold my jeans for $240/pair &amp; $500/ 2 pairs. This was too low for my time/effort. Now, I would sell my same jeans now for $1100 - $1500/pair &amp; $10,000 for/ 10 pairs. Track, every expense down to the button, thread, paint, and label; it all matters. Figure out how you can make the product faster and as cheap as possible.
•	In the beginning YOU are the brand be confident. Confidence is a muscle you need to bulk up, and flex in front of people. I would release my brand ASAP and find that confidence through failure.
•	Don’t rely on family and friends for sales, you need to do it yourself. Use your family for product testing. You need to sell your clothing to people you do not know right away! Get out there and market yourself. Networking with other business owners and clients will, get the brand out there and closer to your buyer personas.  Do it every day! No breaks, no holidays!
•	Get an online presence ASAP but don’t rely on it. Make a Shopify EC site, get on to social media and start marketing yourself and directing leads to your EC site. But you need to be physically in front of the crowds who will buy your product.
•	Market the brand hard!!!! Be fucking aggressive! POST DAILY and don’t quit! You put all this time and money to set everything up, you made your buyer personas! It is time for everyone to know who you are and the value of your brand.
•	If you need help, get help! For photography, videos, editing or anything else that you don’t need to do. Just get the content out there and do it daily.
