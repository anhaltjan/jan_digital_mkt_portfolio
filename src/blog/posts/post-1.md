**If you don’t know me, from now on you will. I'm Jan Anhalt a former Japanese denim jeans designer & formalwear fashion consultant currently living in Japan.**

**My specific focus is working collaboratively with industries intentionally targeting males by optimizing their social media strategy, and content to attain more long-term loyal leads.**

To be straight up with you I just started my career in digital marketing. Currently, I am conducting extensive research about the field and have detected some things that puzzle me. One major proble is, there are many digital marketers who cannot even market themselves; which I find hilariously ironic.

I'm carefully looking at these people and thinking _"Do you know what you are even doing?"_ because to me it seems like you do not, it does not even seem like you are trying. When I see these portfolios, I ask myself _"Would I hire them based on what they have provided?"_ **no I wouldn’t**. Because the initial impression doesn’t inspire confidence that they can perform their job at a high level.

**To be honest, right now looking at “lower tier marketers” I see:**

- Boring cookie-cutter websites
- Out-of-date blogs
- Social media with 0 to 150 followers
- 1-5 likes on a post
- No comments
- No videos posted
- No relevant or creative content
- Private accounts

How can you sell anyone a service if you can't even sell yourself in the first place? It doesn't add up. This is when I realized **I have no competition**

**From that point on, even with all these people. I realized competition is still exceptionally low because very few of them could outperform me.**

When I carefully look at Gary Vaynerchuk, Mr Beast, Casey Neistat, the Kardashian family, The Paul brothers, love him or loathe him and even Donald Trump. I think YEAH! _They undoubtedly perform at a high level. They undoubtedly possess a formidable presence. They are never irrelevant; they typically command a substantial following. Furthermore, they constantly provide new and valuable content for people._ Therefore, of course I would promptly hire these notable people for my company if they were digital marketers. Why? Because they clearly demonstrate their value furthermore, they express opinion, vision, and creativity.

### What I learned

- A person who has social media should be taking advantage of it and post content if not daily, on a weekly basis providing either personal and/or semi-valuable content related to them or their work.
- One person who can do many things can only do them at a mediocre level, one person who focuses on one thing is a master at it.
- A digital marketer who hides her/his face or hides behind a brand seems untrustworthy.
- A digital marketer who offers web development services should have a kickass creative website.
- As a human I want to hear the voice of the person, I want to see their personality.
- I would hire a new person trying hard to learn over a person who is more senior but less privy to share their knowledge.
- Never go out-of-date and always stay relevant
