      I'm Well-traveled with experiences of living and working all over Japan -
      making people genuinely satisfied is what motivates my work. I love
      fashion, design and music. I adapt perfectly well yet, I'm naturally not a
      multi-tasker and choose not to be one. If you need that type of person,
      understood but I do believe focus is needed in order to do our jobs
      properly. This is why I embrace physical/mental challenges designing and
      writing where extreme concentration is needed.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify">
      I earned a high reputation as 'The person' for menswear consulting and
      luxury denim products and tailoring services in my local area with 100+
      regular clients I got through word of mouth and through social media
      gained a few regular clients outside of Canada. After closing my business
      to pursue my dream to live in Japan. I became an ESL instructor, over time
      with over 75 franchise schools across japan requesting for my assistance I
      quickly became one of the top instructors in the company.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      My experience have taught me if you provide an exceptional product and
      deliver it with excpetional service with a strong stratgy that's backed by
      data the higher your organic growth will be, and the easier it will be to
      create amazing relationships with customers that last for years or even
      decades.
