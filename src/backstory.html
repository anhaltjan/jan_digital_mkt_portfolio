      👖I owned a Japanese denim brand “JYAN”. from 2012-2019, it fell apart.

    <li class="list-group-item py-4">
      📈 But I mastered my craft & now I can tailor, design, cut & sew a pair of
      jeans in 4-6 hours.

    <li class="list-group-item py-4">
      💰 I learned sales from selling at farmers markets, as a business owner,
      fashion consultant, formal wear lead salesman & from my denim brand.

      😣 My business failed & I didn't improve my sales because of my one
      weakness, which was marketing

      🥇 So now, I’m integrating those strengths & using them to turn my
      weakness in digital marketing as my top strength to help industries
      targeting men!
