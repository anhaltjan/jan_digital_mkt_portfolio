      Jan Anhalt is a Canadian designer and fashion consultant who honed his
      skills in designing, tailoring, sewing menswear, and consulting in formal
      wear. Despite possessing these skills, there was one significant skill he
      lacked - marketing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he first founded his company, he had very good word of mouth and a
      reputation for creating quality pieces for his clients. However, his
      struggle with perfectionism and low self-confidence to market himself
      prevented his company from scaling, which ultimately led to its failure.
    </p>

      Due to always being fearful of putting himself out there, which held him
      back in his twenties from seizing many personal and financial
      opportunities for growth. His life lesson taught him he needed to change,
      he decided to turn his weakness into strength. He made a conscious effort
      to have thicker skin and grow his confidence, furthering his skills.
    </p>

      Now committed to becoming the best in the industry, Jan Anhalt is
      leveraging his skills in menswear and newfound expertise in digital
      marketing to help companies reach male audiences and improve their organic
      growth on social media.
